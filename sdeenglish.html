                  <p class="mlp">The phone call arrived at 9.37 on the evening of 18 March, Saturday, 
                    the eve of the city's glittering and roaring feast day dedicated to Saint Joseph the carpenter:
                     and to the carpenter, in fact, were offered the bonfires of old furniture that were lit that evening 
                     in the working-class neighbourhoods, as if promising the carpenters still in operation, and now few in 
                     number, a job that would not be missed. The offices were, more than on other evenings at that hour, almost 
                deserted: although illuminated, the evening and night lighting of the police offices tacitly prescribed to give the
                 citizens the impression that their safety was always being watched over in those offices. 1 The telephone operator
                  noted the time and the name of the person making the call: Giorgio Roccella. He had a polite, calm, persuasive voice. 
                  'Like all madmen,' thought the telephonist. He was in fact asking, Mr Roccella, for the Quaestor: crazy, especially at
                   that hour and on that particular evening. The telephonist made an effort at the same tone, but succeeded in a 
                   caricatured imitation, made more uncovered by the coldness with which he replied: 'But the quaestor is never at 
                   the police station at this hour' 2 , a coldness that in those offices usually ran on the frequent absences of the 
                   quaestor. And he added: 'I'll give you the commissioner's office', with the pleasure of spite the commissioner, who 
                   was certainly about to leave the office at that moment. The commissioner was in fact putting on his coat. The brigadier,
                    who had a table at the corner of the commissioner's, picked up the phone. He listened, looked on the table for a pencil
                     and a piece of paper; and as he wrote, he replied that yes, they would go as soon as possible, but as soon as 
                     possible, thus placing the possibility so as not to delude him about the early hour. "Who was it?" asked the 
                     commissioner. "A fellow who, he says, urgently has something to show us that he found in the house." "A corpse?" 
                     joked the commissioner. "No, he actually said something." "A thing... And what's his name, this guy?" The brigadier
                      took the piece of paper on which he had written his name and address and read: "Giorgio Roccella, contrada Cotugno, 
                      from the junction for Monterosso, road to the right, four kilometres; fifteen from here". The commissioner went back 
                      through the door to the brigadier's table, took that piece of paper, read it as if he thought he would find something
                       more in it than what the brigadier had said. He said. "What?" asked the brigadier. "This Roccella," said the 
                       commissioner, "is a diplomat, consul or ambassador I don't know where. He hasn't been here for years, the town
                        house closed, the country house abandoned and almost in ruins, in contrada Cotugno precisely.... The one you 
                        can see from the road: high up, looking like a fort..." "An old farmhouse," said the brigadier, "I've passed 
                        under it many times." "Inside the fence, so it looks like a farmhouse, there is a very pretty little villa; or at
                         least there was.... Great family, that of the Roccella: but now reduced to this consul or ambassador that he
                          is.... I didn't even think he was still alive, since he hasn't been seen for so long'. 'If you like,' said the
                           brigadier, 'I'll go and check. 'But no, I'm sure it's a joke.... Tomorrow, maybe, if you have the time and
                            inclination, go and have a look.... As far as I'm concerned, whatever happens, don't look for me tomorrow: 
                            I'm going to celebrate St Joseph's Day with a friend of mine, in the country."  </p>

                  <p> The next day, on patrol, the brigadier went to contrada Cotugno: in the mood, he and the two officers
                     accompanying him, of taking a trip: from what the commissioner had said, they were sure that the place was
                      uninhabited and that the call the night before had been a joke. A little river, which flowed at the foot of 
                      the hill, was now only a stony riverbed of bone-white stones; but the hill, on top of that ruined farmhouse, 
                      was green. After their inspection, their purpose was to gather asparagus and chicory, festively: all three of 
                      them experts in recognising good wild vegetables, as the farmers they had been. They filtered into the enclosure,
                       which was not made, as looking down one might have thought, of simple walls: they were warehouses, the doors closed 
                       by shiny bolts, surrounding the small villa, really pretty and with many signs of disintegration, of ruin. They
                        walked around it. All the shutters were closed, except for one window through whose glass one could look in. 
                        Standing in the dazzling light of that March morning, they first saw the interior confusedly: then they began 
                        to distinguish, and all three of them, repeating the test by shielding themselves from the sun with their hands, 
                        seemed certain to see a man who, with his back to the window, sat at a desk, slumped down there. The brigadier 
                        took the decision to break the window pane, open it, and enter the room: the man could have collapsed from an 
                        illness, he was perhaps in time to help him. But the man was dead, and not from syncope or heart attack; in his 
                        head, resting on the desk, between his jaw and temple, was a blackish lump. To the two officers, who had also
                         climbed in through the window, the Brigadier shouted: "Don't touch anything!"; and in order not to touch the 
                         telephone, which was on the desk, he ordered one of the officers to go back to the police station, to report back,
                          to send for the doctor, the photographer and those two or three who were considered and privileged scientific 
                          experts at the police station: according to the Brigadier, they were only privileged, as they had not yet
                           experienced a single case in which they had made a decisive contribution, or rather a case of confusion. Given 
                           those orders, and continuing to tell the officer who had remained with him not to touch anything, the brigadier 
                           began to do his observational work, depending on the written report that he was then to make: a rather thankless
                            task always, his years of schooling and his infrequent reading not being enough to familiarise him with Italian. 
                            But, curiously enough, the fact that he had to write about the things he saw, the worry, the anguish almost, gave
                             his mind a capacity for selection, for choice, for essentiality, so that sensible and acute ended up being what 
                             remained in the web of writing. So it is perhaps with Italian writers from the south, Sicilians in particular: despite 
                             high school, university and much reading. Immediately, the impression was that the man had committed suicide. The pistol
                              was on the floor, to the right of the armchair on which he had been sitting: an old '15-'18 war weapon, German, one of
                               those souvenirs that veterans used to take home. But there was, to erase in the brigadier the immediate impression of 
                               suicide, a detail: the dead man's right hand, which should have been hanging flush with the fallen gun, was instead on 
                               the desk top, stopping a sheet of paper on which it read: "I have found." That point after the word 'found' flashed through the brigadier's mind, unfolding, swift and elusive, the scene of a murder behind the not very carefully constructed one of suicide. The man had begun to write "I have found", just as he had said at the police station that he had found something in the house that he had not expected to find: and he was about to write about what he had found, by now doubting that the police were coming and perhaps beginning, in the loneliness, in the silence, to be afraid. But there had been a knock at the door. 'The police' he thought; and it was instead the murderer. Perhaps he introduced himself as a policeman: and the man let him in, sat down at his desk, and began to tell about what he had found. The pistol was perhaps lying on the desk, in his growing fear he had probably gone to get it out of some storeroom he remembered (the brigadier did not believe that murderers would equip themselves with such an old tool). Seeing it on the table, the murderer perhaps asked for information about the weapon, checked its operation, suddenly pointed it at the other man's head and fired. And then the great gimmick of putting the dot after 'I have found': 'I have found that life is not worth living', 'I have found the one and only truth', 'I have found', 'I have found': the all and the nothing. It did not hold. But on the part of the murderer, that point was not a mistake: for the suicide thesis, which would certainly have surfaced 6 (the brigadier was sure of it), existential and philosophical meanings would have been extracted from that point, and especially if the personality of the murderer had offered some kind of addent. On the desk there was a set of keys, an old pewter inkwell, and a photograph, of a large and cheerful group, which had been taken in the garden at least fifty years earlier: perhaps right out there, when there should have been trees of harmony and shade around the house, now only dryness and brushwood. 7 Next to the sheet of paper with the "I have found", the closed fountain-pen: the murderer's finesse (the brigadier was increasingly certain that it was a murder), giving the impression that with that point the man had indeed put a full stop to his existence. The room, all around, had almost empty bookshelves. The books that remained were bound vintages of law journals, agronomy manuals, issues of a magazine entitled 'Nature and Art'. Then there were, one on top of the other, some volumes that must have been old, on the spines of which the brigadier read Calepinus. He had always believed that Calepinus was a little book to be kept in one's pocket, a notebook, a handbook: it seemed curious to him that that name should come from those little books, each weighing ten kilos at least. The scruple of not leaving those imprints in which he did not believe diverted him from the curiosity of opening one of those volumes; and for the same scruple, followed by the agent, he wandered about the house without touching furniture or handles, entering only by the doors that were open. The house was larger than, looking at it from the outside, one might have thought. There was a large dining room with a massive oak table and four sideboards, of the same wood, with plates, soup tureens, glasses and cookware inside; but also old toys, papers, linen. Bedrooms, two with mattresses and pillows piled on the bedsteads, one with a bed that looked like someone had slept in it the night before, there were three; and perhaps others behind doors that the brigadier did not open. The house had been abandoned and even stripped of furniture, books, paintings and porcelain (there were a few signs of the things that had been left behind), but it did not give the impression of being uninhabited. Cigarette butts were in the ashtrays, and wine grounds in the glasses, five of them, which had been brought into the kitchen certainly with the intention of rinsing them out. The kitchen was spacious, with wood-burning hearths, an oven, Valencian tiles walled around it; copper pots and pans hung on the walls: they gave a certain glow, in the little light, even if they were green with sulphate by now. From the kitchen, a small door opened onto a staircase that climbed narrow and dark, and it was impossible to see where it ended. The brigadier looked to see if there was a light to turn on to illuminate that staircase. Seeing no other switch than the one that lit the lamps on the hearths, he ventured up that ladder. But after five or six steps he began, still hesitantly climbing, to light matches. He lit many before arriving, at the top, at a kind of attic, a room so high that one of normal stature could almost touch the ceiling with his head, but as wide as the dining room below. It was full of sofas, armchairs and broken chairs; of chests; of empty frames; of dusty draperies. Round and round were reliquary busts of saints: ten or so, gilded; but standing out among them was a larger bust, its chest silver, its cape black, its face wet.

                  <p> A little less than two hours later, everyone who was supposed to arrive arrived: quaestor, public prosecutor, doctor, photographer, a journalist favoured by the quaestor 9 and a swarm of agents, among whom the forensic team stood out for its snobbishness.
                     Six or seven cars, which even after they had arrived, continued to rumble, screech and shout, just as they had set off from the city centre, arousing the curiosity of the citizens and also that - an effect the quaestor wished for as late as possible - of the carabinieri: whereupon the colonel of the carabinieri, gloomy in the face, very angry, ready to quarrel, with all due respect, with the quaestor, arrived half an hour later, the doors all already open with those keys lying on the desk, the fingerprinting already somewhat haphazardly begun, the dead man photographed on all sides. With contained fury the colonel said, "But you could have given us a warning." "Excuse me," said the quaestor, "but everything took place so hastily, in a matter of minutes." "Yeah, yeah..." said the colonel ironically. The gun was pulled up by inserting a pencil in the loop of the trigger, it was gently laid on a black cloth, delicately wrapped. "Fingerprints at once," said the quaestor. The dead man's had been taken. "Useless work," he then sentenced, "but it must be done." "Why useless?" asked the colonel. "Suicide," said the quaestor solemnly, thus deciding that the colonel was beginning to cultivate a contrary opinion. "Mr Quaestor..." intervened the brigadier . "What you have to say, you will say later in your report.... In the meantime...": but in the meantime he did not know what there was to say or do except repeat: "Suicide, clear case of suicide". The brigadier tried again: "Mr Quaestor...". He wanted to tell him about the phone call the night before, about that point after the 'I found it'. But the quaestor cut: 'We want the report', he pointed to himself and the prosecutor, looked at his watch, 'early afternoon'. And turning to the prosecutor and the colonel: "This is a simple case, we must not let it build up and get it done as soon as possible... Go and write the report, now". Automatically, the colonel saw, however, the case as very complicated, and in any case not to be hurried along. There was immediately, prejudicially, whatever the people representing them, an irreducible disparity of viewpoints between the two institutions: the Carabinieri and the police force. A long, historical dispute divided them: and all citizens who fell between them ended up struggling dramatically. 10 The brigadier said "Sir", went out to find the patrol car he had come in and returned. But since the quaestor had annoyed him, and since he was almost completely lacking in what is usually called esprit de corps - that is, in considering the corps to which he belonged a greater part of the whole, in considering it infallible and, in the event of fallibility, untouchable, overflowing with reason especially when he was wrong - he had a mocking idea. In the car in which the colonel had come, sitting at the wheel was the brigadier (of the carabinieri) who was driving it. Our brigadier went and sat next to him, who knew him well although without confidence: and told him everything he knew about the case, all his suspicions. He also pointed out to him, at the warehouse doors, those shiny new bolts; and he went back to his office as if relieved, to write in two hours what he had told his peer in five minutes. So, back in the city, the colonel of the carabinieri learned from his brigadier what it took to make the case more
                      complicated than the quaestor wished.
                      Despite the fact that it was Sunday and St. Joseph's Day, personal and cadastral data, more or less confidential information, immediately flowed to the police headquarters and the Carabinieri command. The same or almost the same, from the same sources and from the same confidants: which, if they had worked in concordance, would have saved one of the two parties the time and effort that could have been more usefully employed: but we are vaguely envisaging something as impossible as collaboration between a builder and a bomber (and it is well understood that similar roles do not suit either party). 11 The identity of the victim: Giorgio Roccella of Monterosso, born in Monterosso on 14 January 1923, a retired diplomat. He had been consul of Italy in various European cities, had finally stopped in Edinburgh where, separated from his wife, he lived with a 20-year-old son. He had not returned to Italy after fifteen years, except to tragically die there on 18 March 1989. He had been the only one of the family to retain, but not care for, a few fragments of a vast and varied property: a half-destroyed house in the city, that little villa with little land around it. He had arrived in town that very day, the 18th; he had had lunch at the restaurant Le tre candele ordering spaghetti with squid ink and octopus salad; he had called a taxi to be taken to the cottage. He had made sure, he told the taxi driver, that the keys he had worked to open the door, after which he dismissed him, and that he would return to pick him up the next day at eleven o'clock. "I suffer from insomnia," he explained, "I will work all night". But the next day at eleven o'clock, seeing all that movement of police and carabinieri, the taxi driver had turned back without going up to the cottage. Perhaps, he thought, the man was a dangerous wanted man. And why go and get into trouble? 12 The police commissioner, sufficiently irritated by the report, which adumbrated murder, of the brigadier, from the information that the victim had separated from his wife (or, he preferred, his wife from him), drew reason to reinforce his suicide hypothesis. The question of why he had called the police first, he asked himself, but it did not worry him: he wanted, he answered himself, to kill himself in front of the police, to give his gesture more originality and clamour. 13 Prey to madness, in short. But the brigadier, paying more attention to the information phonogram, pointed out to the quaestor that the separation from his wife had taken place twelve years earlier. Painful as it is, such a case is unlikely to reach the pinnacle of despair twelve years later. Instead, the police commissioner's irritation with the brigadier reached its peak. "Don't allow yourself to make such remarks," he said, "and have the commissioner return at once, wherever he is" 14

                  <p> The commissioner, as Saturday had announced, made himself unavailable until Monday morning. At eight o'clock he entered the office, where the brigadier already stood, hooded, wrapped in a scarf that covered even his mouth, gloved. He turned away from it all, shivering: "It's almost as cold in here as it is outside: the birds here would be electrocuted". He had learned the fact from radio and newspapers, he said. He read the brigadier's skeletal report without comment and went out to confer with the quaestor. He returned, apparently angry with the brigadier. "Let's not make novels," he warned him. 15 But the novel was already in the air. Two hours later, Professor Carmelo Franzò, an old friend of the victim, sat in the office to fuel it. He recounted that on Saturday 18, he had unexpectedly seen Giorgio Roccella arrive at home. Explanation of that sudden trip: he had remembered that in a chest that must still be in the attic of the cottage there were some packages of old letters: one from Garibaldi to his great-grandfather, another from Pirandello to his grandfather (they had gone to high school together); and he had had the fantasy of recovering them, of working on them a little. He asked him to accompany him, in the afternoon, to the little villa; but the professor had, that very afternoon, to do his periodic and inalienable dialysis, on pain of intoxicated immobility for days. He would have loved to return to that cottage after so many years and participate in the search. They parted, making an appointment for the following day, Sunday; but on Sunday evening, news of his friend's death came over the radio. But he had other information to add, the professor; and crucial. On Saturday evening, a telephone call from his friend. He telephoned from the cottage: and first he said: 'I didn't know they had put a telephone here'; then he said that, searching in the attic for letters, he had found, behold, he had found the famous painting. "What painting?" the professor had asked. "The one that disappeared a few years ago: don't you remember?" had said Roccella. The professor was not sure he had guessed which painting it was; he advised him, however, to call the police. "What a complicated story, "16 said the commissioner between incredulity and concern: "the painting, the telephone; two things that Mr Roccella, at the time he spoke to you, had just discovered...". And even more incredulously, to the professor: "Did you believe him?". "I believed him all my life: why just the day before yesterday would I start not believing him?". 17 In the meantime, the brigadier had taken the telephone directory, leafed through it, looked it up and read: "Roccella Giorgio di Monterosso, contrada Cotugno, 342260... It's in the directory'. "Thank you," said the commissioner acidly. "But it is not the fact that it is there that interests me; it is the fact that he knew nothing about it that intrigues me." "We can ..." began the brigadier . "You can: and you will at once . Go to the telephone office, get all the details of the application, the date of implantation, the bills paid.... Photocopy everything, indeed...". And to the professor: "Let's go back to the famous painting: disappeared, reappeared to your friend and, presumably, disappeared again... You, it seemed to me, have an idea of which painting your friend meant...' "And you?" returned the professor. "Not me," said the commissioner. "I don't know about paintings; and a colleague of mine from Rome is a
                     specialist in missing paintings, of which there are many in Italy. 
                     We will consult him... But in the meantime tell me what that missing painting is, in your opinion..." "I'm not a specialist in missing paintings," said the professor. "But you do have an opinion." "It's the same as you should have." "Christ: always like that... Even with professors." "Even with commissioners," the professor retorted bitterly. The commissioner restrained himself: had it been anyone else, he might have thrown her in the security room: but Professor Franzò was known and respected throughout the city, generations of students had fond and grateful memories of him. So: 'Repeat to me as faithfully as possible what your friend told you in person and on the phone'. The professor, nervously, so nervously that he hyphenated, began to repeat. "Aren't you omitting something?" the commissioner retaliated. "I have a good memory and a habit of omitting nothing." 18 "Fine, fine," said the commissioner, "but bear in mind that you will soon have to repeat everything, word for word, to the judge." The professor smiled between pity and indignation. But to end the skirmish, the quaestor, who had been the professor's pupil, entered. "Professor, you here?" "And with an interesting tale," said the commissioner. But the brigadier's return brought agitation. "The request is there, from three years ago; but with a forged signature.... The carabinieri have already ascertained this". 19 "Damn!" shouted the quaestor, addressing the carabinieri.

            But having dissolved, through the professor's testimony, the suicide thesis, which the quaestor had at first accepted and the colonel of the carabinieri immediately rejected, they were both urged by their superiors to meet and exchange information, hypotheses and suspicions. They met, as it were, through gritted teeth; but they could not be completely vague and nonsensical. They reconstructed: Mr. Roccella, on a whim to find the letters of Garibaldi and Pirandello, had suddenly returned after so many years; he had gone to visit his friend; he had had lunch at the restaurant; he had taken the keys to the little villa from the town house, or already had them with him; he had had a taxi take him there. There, having ascertained that the keys were still needed, he had been left to do his research. But what had happened since then? He had found a phone planted: but he didn't seem to have been that surprised, from what the professor reported. Which meant he had no idea who had it implanted. Instead, he had been very surprised, perhaps frightened, to discover, in the attic where he had gone to look for the letters, that painting. The phone call to his friend, therefore, the phone call to the police. And since the police were late in arriving, he had begun to write: 'I have found...'. 
            But undoubtedly frightened, he had gone to fish out the old Mauser. And just then, probably, he heard a knock. Finally the police. He went to open it: but it was his murderer. Points to sift through: had the phone really been planted without his knowledge? was his return really due to his desire to find the letters from Garibaldi and Pirandello? had he really seen that painting or was it a family picture he no longer remembered and had resurfaced among the many junk items in the attic? A new and more meticulous search of the cottage had to be carried out. But while they were deciding on it, something happened that brought great trouble and upheaval. A local train, at that hour - two o'clock in the afternoon - usually loaded with students, had been stopped at the traffic lights before the station of Monterosso by the obstruction signal. He had waited for the signal to change: but half an hour had passed before the traffic light's red light. The national road ran parallel to the railway. Students and railwaymen swarmed along it, swearing at the stationmaster at Monterosso, who had either forgotten to clear the way or had fallen asleep. Very few cars passed along the road at that hour; and only one stopped to ask what had happened to that train. A Volvo. The train conductor asked the driver a favour: that he go up to Monterosso station to wake the stationmaster. The Volvo climbed towards the station, they saw it stop and then disappear. Evidently, it had descended from another branch of the road. With the traffic light at red, after a while the stationmaster, followed by a few passengers, walked up - five hundred metres - to the station: but they discovered to their horror that the stationmaster and the labourer were asleep, but in eternal sleep. They had been murdered. Impartially, the Carabinieri and police were called: both immediately set out to find the man in the Volvo. Not a difficult search, considering that there were no more than thirty Volvos in the entire province. The man in the Volvo did the same when he heard on the radio that the police were looking for him and realised that it would not be long before they found him. He therefore went to the police station reluctantly and apprehensively 20 : but, as it was written in the incipit of the report, spontaneously. Surname and first name, place and date of birth, residence, profession; and whether he had ever dealt with the law. "Not even for a traffic violation," said the man. But the stated profession gave the commissioner the ineffable joy of starting the interrogation harshly: pharmaceutical company representative. "Do you own a Volvo?" "Evidently." "Don't say evidently, when you answer me.... Your Volvo is quite expensive." The man nodded. "Do the drugs you sell include heroin, cocaine, opium?" "Look," - the man said, cooling his anger and fear - "I came here, spontaneously, just to tell you what I saw yesterday afternoon." "Go ahead and tell," said the commissioner with an incredulous air. "I went up to the station, as the train conductor had begged me. I knocked on the windows of the stationmaster's office, he opened for me" "Who?" "The stationmaster, I think." "So you didn't know him." "No. I told him what the stationmaster had told me to tell him. I just looked inside the office: there were two other men, and they were rolling up a carpet.... I left." "But by another way," said the commissioner, "and since no one saw him laughing, I went down.... And so: they were rolling up a carpet." "The painting," escaped the brigadier. The commissioner glowered at him: "I thank you, but I would have got there without your help." "But for pity's sake,

                  <p>Brigadier Antonio Lagandara had been born in a farming village so close to the city that he could now consider himself part of it. His father, a farm labourer who had risen to the rank of pruner - an expert, a sought-after one - had died, falling from a tall cherry tree that he was remolding from the dry, when he was in the last year of an economics and commerce course. He had taken his diploma but, not knowing what to do and not finding a job, had joined the police; and had become, five years later, a non-commissioned officer. He was passionate about the job and therefore wanted to make a career of it. He enrolled in law school, attended it whenever and however he could, and studied. A law degree was the supreme ambition of his life, his dream: hence the joke that seemed malicious to the commissioner. He was still resenting it, when the brigadier returned from escorting the man in the Volvo, whose shouts of protest now echoed throughout the police station, to the security room. "I'm a graduate, eh? I still haven't figured out if you're really clueless or pretending to be.... Graduate! In a country where ushers, waiters and even garbage collectors are now graduates'. 22 "Excuse me" - said the brigadier sincerely but grumpily. "Never mind... I'm going now to the police commissioner: in a quarter of an hour you'll accompany the man in the Volvo to him". In the quaestor's office was the colonel of the carabinieri; they were both informed by the commissioner. When, with the brigadier, the man from the Volvo entered, the police commissioner immediately: 'You then, in the stationmaster's office, saw three men rolling up a carpet. Was there a corpse inside?". "A corpse? Certainly not." "How wide was the carpet?" "But I don't know. Maybe five feet." "How do you claim it was a carpet?" asked the colonel. "I claim nothing: it looked like a carpet to me." "Describe it." "They were rolling it up, it seemed to me, inside out: coarse, rough canvas..." "But the inside out of a carpet is not like that. Is it possible they were rolling up a painting instead?" "It is possible," said the man. "Let's move on... The men, you said, were three." "Yes, three." The quaestor showed him two photographs, "Here are two of them, do you recognise them?" They were trying to set a trap for him; the man inwardly cursed them. "But what do you recognise? These two I think I have never seen in my life." "Do you know who they are? The stationmaster and the labourer: the very ones who were murdered". "But I haven't seen them!" "But if you said you saw and spoke to the stationmaster!" "With one whom I believed to be the stationmaster." "I'm sorry," said the quaestor, "but I'm forced to keep you here again". The unfortunate man went back to shouting his protest. The quaestor and colonel took stock of their investigation with the investigating magistrate. The magistrate assumed an air of grave thought and then said: 'You know what I think? That random as it may be, the man in the Volvo walked into the stationmaster's office, saw that painting, fell in love with it at first sight, took the two of them out and took it with him'. The quaestor and colonel exchanged puzzled and ironic glances. "He's a character, this Volvo, for whom I have an immediate fondness. I am rarely wrong, in my intuitions. Keep him well in the cooler. He dismissed them, he had to hear old Professor Franzò. Leaving, the quaestor said: "My God!"; and the colonel: "Terrifying!". The magistrate had meanwhile risen to greet his old professor. "With what pleasure I see you again, after so many years!" "So many: and they weigh me down," agreed the professor. "What are you talking about? You have not changed at all, in appearance." "She has," said the professor with his usual frankness. "This damn job... But why do you call me 'sir'?" "Same as then," said the professor. "But now..." "No." "But do you remember me?" "Of course I remember." "May I take the liberty of asking you a question? Then I will ask you others, of a different nature.... In my Italian essays you always gave me a three, because I copied. But once she gave me a five: why?". "Because she had copied from a more intelligent author'. The magistrate burst out laughing. "The Italian: I was rather weak in Italian. But, as you see, it was no big deal: here I am, prosecutor of the Republic..." "Italian is not Italian: it is reasoning," said the professor. "With less Italian, you would perhaps be even higher up." The joke was fierce.
                     The magistrate paled. And he moved on to a harsh interrogation.

                  <p> The victim's son from Edinburgh, his wife from Stuttgart, arrived on the same day. It was, between mother and son, and also for the investigators who were present, a very unpleasant encounter. The wife had evidently come to grab what she could of the estate; the son to prevent her from doing so, but above all to find out how and why his father had been killed, and by whom. The meeting took place in the quaestor's office. They did not say goodbye, the son's greeting was a dry: "You can go back to Stuttgart, there is nothing for you". "You say that." "I don't say so, the papers my father had recorded a few years ago say so." "I'm not sure those papers count, that they're not challengeable.... Let's agree, sell everything and leave." "I'm not selling: I might stay here. I came here, and stayed a long time, many years ago: my grandparents were still here. I have a beautiful memory of it... Yes, maybe I'll stay here... With my father we often thought of coming back, of living here." "With your father!" said the woman sarcastically. "You mean he wasn't my father?... Look: mothers cannot be chosen, that I certainly would not have chosen you.... On the other hand, you certainly wouldn't have chosen me as your son.... But fathers are chosen: and I chose Giorgio, I loved him, I mourn his death. He was my father. You attach too much importance to the fact that you slept with another; or with others'. The mother's lacquered and ringed hand flashed across her son's cheek. The boy turned his back on her, looking at the bookshelf as if he really cared. He was crying. The quaestor said: "That is your business. I want to know, from you, madam, if you have any reason or suspicion about the killing of your husband. The lady shrugged her shoulders. "He was Sicilian," she said, "and Sicilians, for years now, who knows why, have been killing each other. 24 "Indefectible judgement," said the son ironically, returning to sit in front of the quaestor's desk. "And what do you think, what do you know?" the quaestor asked him. "About the reasons why he was killed, nothing; indeed, I hope, sooner or later, to learn them from you.... For the rest...". He told of his father's decision to return to find Garibaldi's and Pirandello's letters, of his regret at not being able to accompany him, of the telephone call in which his father assured him that he had travelled very well. Nothing else. "Tell me something about your properties here. Were they abandoned at all?" "Yes and no. From time to time my father would write to a fellow, I think a priest, to find out about the state of maintenance." "But the priest was in charge of maintenance?" "Not precisely, I think." "Did your father send him money?" "I don't think so." "Did he answer his father's letters?" "Yes, he always said that everything, despite the abandonment, was well maintained". "Did he, the priest, have the keys to the town house and the cottage?". "I don't know." "Do you remember the name of it?" 
                    "Mater, I think. Father Cricco. But I'm not sure."

                  <p> Padre Cricco- bell'uomo, alto e solenne nella veste talare - affermò che mai aveva avuto le chiavi: guardava da fuori la casa di città e il villino: e le sue notizie si limitavano ad assicurare che erano ancora all'impiedi, senza crepe vistose e senza irreparabili erosioni. Interrogava il commissario - riguardoso, complimentoso - e il brigadiere verbalizzava. Cominciò: «Lei è tra i pochi preti che ancora vestono da preti. È un fatto, non so bene perché, che mi rincuora». «Sono un prete all'antica; e lei è un cattolico all'antica. Buon per noi, io presuntuosamente dico». «Da prete, da uomo intelligente, da amico del morto, che cosa pensa di questo caso?». «Nonostante tutto il romanzo che vi si va costruendo intorno, confesso che non riesco a togliermi dalla testa l'ipotesi del suicidio. Giorgio non era un cuor contento». «Già: quella moglie, quel figlio che non era suo figlio...». «Ma pare che la polizia scientifica...». «Sì, ha trovato sulla pistola più di un'impronta del morto; ma proprio nei punti dove avrebbe dovuto impugnarla per spararsi, sono come cancellate, quasi fosse stata impugnata da una mano guantata...Ma io, con tutto il rispetto per la polizia scientifica, a questo responso mi affido poco». 25  Il brigadiere , che il vizio d'intervenire non lo perdeva, disse: «Anch'io mi ci affido poco e quasi niente. Ma è impossibile immaginare che un uomo, dopo aver maneggiato una pistola, al momento di suicidarsi si metta il guanto, si spari e abbia poi il tempo di ritogliersi il guanto e di farlo sparire. Roba da hellzapoppin». «Ti diverti, eh... Continua a divertirti, continua» disse acre il commissario. </p>

                  <p> The police and judicial authorities decided, accompanying his wife and son, as well as Professor Franzò, to conduct another search of the cottage. The commissioner, the brigadier and a swarm of agents went there. Father Cricco declined the invitation to go: it excited him too much and his presence would have been completely useless. To fetch the professor from home, the brigadier went. The two of them made the short journey alone, much to the delight of the brigadier, who felt a sort of thrill talking to people with a reputation for intelligence and culture. But the professor spoke of his own ills, leaving memorable to the brigadier (but not shareable in the energy of his thirties) the phrase that at a certain point in life, hope is not the last to die, but dying is the last hope. 26 The professor knew the place, many hours of his childhood and youth had been spent there with his friend. As soon as they entered the enclosure, pointing to the warehouses, he said: they used to be the stables. But the brigadier was surprised to see the doors wide open, the bolts gone. He thought it had been the Carabinieri, told the commissioner about it, then telephoned the Carabinieri when they entered the house. It had not been them, they knew nothing about it. Nervously, the brigadier inspected the storerooms one by one. He smelled burnt sugar, macerated eucalyptus leaves, alcohol: something indefinable, in short. He said to the commissioner: "Can you smell it?". "I don't smell anything, I'm very cold." "You should bring in some experts, some chemists; and the dogs of the financial police". "The best dog is you," said the commissioner. 27 "Anyway, we'll get experts and dogs to come." In front of the cottage door, the others waited. The commissioner had the keys, he gave them to the brigadier and said: "Open up and lead the way: it's my first time there". They all swarmed inside, the officers with a fury as if they were about to catch a thief, the boy looking around with eyes shining with emotion, the woman cold, as if bored. On the ground floor there was, for the officers, nothing they had not already seen. They went up to the first floor, entered the kitchen. The little door to the attic was gloomily open. They stopped there; then the commissioner stepped forward, climbed the wooden ladder with agility and confidence: and when he got up there, he flooded the attic with light. And the others followed. The brigadier, moving cautiously among all that piled-up stuff, turned and turned his gaze on the walls. "What are you looking for?" the commissioner asked. "The switch." "Ah, yes: you've never managed to find it. But it's not difficult: it's behind the bust of Saint Ignatius." "But you can't see it," said the brigadier . "Intuited," said the commissioner. And he joked: "Don't tell me I found it because I'm a graduate". But his eyes had glazed over as if with terror. "I won't tell you," said the brigadier: gloomily. On the chest there was, uncovered by the thick layer of dust that covered everything, a clear sign that something had been lying there for a long time. The rolled-up painting, thought the brigadier : and said so. Poor Roccella had therefore seen it before even opening the chest and looking for the letters: they were there, packed: those of Garibaldi, those of Pirandello. The professor, in years gone by, had also seen them. He leafed through Pirandello's, lingered over a few sentences. At eighteen, Pirandello was thinking about what he would write until he was over sixty. On the return journey, the professor said to the brigadier: "These letters by Pirandello, I'd like to read them to myself. "I don't think it will be difficult to get them entrusted to him'. But he was thinking of something else: gloomy, restless, nervous; he felt he needed to confide, to vent. At one point he stopped the car and nervously began to cry. "We've been together for three years, in the same office." "I see," said the professor. "The switch?" "The switch... He had said he had never been in that house: she felt it too.... I had consumed a whole box of matches, looking for that switch; the others had then come looking for it with pocket bulbs.... And he, on the other hand, found it at once, at a glance'. "Incredible mistake on his part," said the professor. "But how could he do it, what happened to him at that moment?" "Perhaps a phenomenon of sudden splitting: in that moment he became the policeman hunting himself." 28 And enigmatically, as if speaking to himself, he added: 'Pirandello'. "I want to tell you everything that, starting now from the switch, I am putting together arithmetically." "Arithmetically..." smiled the professor. "But I'm always clearing up some doubts for you." "So I ask you to help me." "As much as I can... But come up to my house: we'll be quieter." They talked for hours, coming to the conclusion that, on the part of those thugs,
                     the painting had been an incautious.

                  <p>The next day, the commissioner arrived at the office at the usual time, flaunting his usual good humour to the point of euphoria. He took off his hat, gloves, coat, the lively but elegant scarf; he slipped the gloves into his coat pocket, hung everything in the wardrobe. The gloves. While the commissioner shivered from the cold in the office, as he did every morning, saying that birds would drop dead there, the brigadier, already at his own table, shivered with another chill. The gloves, that is, the gloves. "Already at work," said the commissioner by way of greeting. "But what work, I'm going through the newspapers." "And what's good about it?" "Nothing good, as usual." There was between them, underneath that exchange of usual and banal phrases, an unease, a coldness, something worried and fearful. The switch. The glove. The brigadier knew nothing, nor would he have appreciated it, of a famous series of engravings by Max Klinger entitled A Glove, but in his mind the commissioner's glove passed, transcended, soared as then in Max Klinger's imagination. Their desks were arranged at an angle. Each sat in front of his own, the commissioner pretended to be immersed in reading the papers in front of him, the brigadier in reading the newspapers. The brigadier was several times on the verge of getting up and going to the police commissioner to tell him everything: but he was held back by the thought that everything he had to say would appear insubstantial to the police commissioner. The commissioner - the brigadier suddenly realised this - had other and more immediately deadly thoughts. At a certain point the commissioner got up, went to a cupboard, took out a small bottle of lubricating oil, a woollen cloth, a pipe cleaner. He said: "I haven't cleaned this gun in years". He took it out of the case he wore on his belt, placed it on the table. Then he opened it, dropped the cartridges on the table. The brigadier understood. On the newspaper in front of him, which he pretended to read, the words clumped together, merged, melted into the headline that the brigadier thought he would read in the following day's papers: Police Commissioner mistakenly kills his subordinate. 30 He said: 'I always clean my... But are you a good shot?" "Excellent," said the commissioner. And the brigadier, as a warning and a discharge of conscience: "Mind you, hitting the centre of a target is not enough to be considered a good marksman. You need dexterity, quickness...' 'I know'. Eh no, thought the brigadier, you don't: or at least you don't know as well as I do. He put his gun down every morning in the top right-hand drawer of his desk. He opened it slowly, silently with his right hand while he held the newspaper in front of him with his left. His hands had become more agile and as if multiplied, all his senses sharper. Everything in him vibrated, like a thin, taut metal rope. The atavistic peasant instinct to distrust, to watch out, to suspect, to foresee the worst and to recognise it had awakened in him to paroxysm. The commissioner finished cleaning the pistol, reloaded it, and held it, pretending to aim at a lamp, a calendar, or a door knob; but by the time he suddenly aimed it at the brigadier and fired, the latter had already thrown himself to the ground with the whole chair, had discovered from the newspaper he was holding in his left hand the pistol he had pulled from the drawer, fired a shot straight at the commissioner's heart, which collapsed on the papers in front of him, profusely bloodying them. "He was a good shot," said the brigadier looking at the bullet hole behind his desk, "but I warned him": almost as if he had won in a competition. But soon afterwards he began to cry and chatter his teeth.

                  <p>"Let us summarise," said the quaestor. "Let's summarise and decide.... Decide, that is, Mr Prosecutor: we will soon have journalists at the door." In the prosecutor's office. There was also the colonel of the carabinieri and in front of them, like a defendant before the Court of Assizes, the brigadier . "Let us summarise, then. According to the brigadier's account, not devoid of probative elements, of clues that I, I confess, made the mistake of not considering as I should, the facts are as I will briefly set out. On the evening of the 18th, Mr. Roccella's phone call arrives at the police station: he asks for someone to come to him to see a certain thing. The brigadier replies that someone will go as soon as possible. He informs the commissioner of the content of the phone call, and offers to go: but the commissioner says he does not believe Mr Roccella has returned after so many years; he thinks it is a joke. He told the Brigadier to make a detour to the place the next day, and left saying that for the whole of the following day, St Joseph's Day, he would be nowhere to be found: and he really was... It is easy to suspect that he warned his accomplices of the unpredictable return of Mr Roccella; and it is even easier to suspect that he went there in person, had himself opened up as police commissioner, sat down next to him at the desk where Roccella had begun to write about the painting he had found; and at the right moment, taking the gun that was unexpectedly lying on the table, he grabbed it with a gloved hand and shot him in the head. He had then put a full stop to the phrase 'I have found'; and he had left, locking himself behind the door, which had a snap lock.... I must say, in self-criticism, that that dot after "I found", which the brigadier pointed out to me as incongruous, did not make an impression on me at the time. I thought that Roccella had gone mad, that he had come to find a solution in suicide and that he had fantasized about committing suicide in front of the police... But the next day the dead man would certainly be discovered: hence the need for the eviction. In the night, the whole gang was summoned: paintings and other tools of clandestine work were moved." "Where?" asked the magistrate. "According to the brigadier, and also in my opinion, to the Monterosso station, where stationmaster and labourer were already of the gang, even if marginally, at the level of speakers, dealers... Undoubtedly, seeing all that voluminous and compromising stuff arrive, stationmaster and labourer got scared. They protested, perhaps threatened: and were killed. They had already been killed when the Volvo man arrived at the station; hence their hasty escape.... The Volvo man did not see the stationmaster and the labourer: he saw their murderers... We ascertained this by showing him photographs of the stationmaster and the labourer: never seen... Then there was the episode of the switch: that did not only impress the brigadier". "What an idiot!" said the magistrate: in eulogy to the commissioner. And then: "But dear quaestor, but dear colonel, this is too little... If we tried to turn this story around on the assumption that the brigadier is lying and that he is the protagonist of the facts he accuses the commissioner of?" The quaestor and the colonel exchanged with their eyes that "My God!" and that "Terrifying!" they had exchanged verbally days before. "That's not possible," they both said. Then the quaestor invited the brigadier out: "Wait in the anteroom, we will call you in five minutes". They called him back more than an hour later. "Accident," said the magistrate. "Accident" said the quaestor. "Accident," said the colonel. And so in the newspapers: Brigadier accidentally kills Chief Constable while cleaning his gun. 31

                    While the police station was busy setting up the funeral chamber for the commissioner (the funeral would be solemn), the man in the Volvo, taken out of prison, was taken there for the bureaucratic formalities for which he would finally be completely free. Those formalities having been completed, he was leaving, dishevelled and agonisingly hilarious, when on the threshold he met Father Cricco in a niche, surplice and stole, who was coming to bless the body. Father Cricco stopped him with a gesture. He said: "I think I know you: are you from my parish?". "What parish? I have no parish," said the man; and he went out in joyful fury. He found his Volvo in the car park, with a ticket stub. But it seemed a laughing matter to him, so happy was he. He left the city singing. But at a certain point he suddenly stopped the car, became angry, anxious again. "That priest,' he said to himself, 'that priest.... I would have recognised him at once, if he hadn't been dressed as a priest: he was the stationmaster, the one I had believed to be the stationmaster" . He thought of going back to the police station. But a moment later: "What, am I going to get into trouble again, and bigger trouble?". He started singing his way home again.
