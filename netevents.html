            <h2>The project</h2>
            <p>The project <i>"Sicilia '80"</i> was born with the aim of showing the political,
               social and cultural situation in Sicily during the 80s.
            We decided to set as a starting point the book of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Sciascia">Leonardo Sciascia</a>: <i>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una_storia_semplice_(novel)">Una storia semplice</a>"</i>.
             Leonardo Sciascia was in fact the first italian 
            writer to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia">mafia</a> in a novel. As he claimed: <i>"Ho dovuto fare i conti da trent'anni a 
              questa parte prima con coloro che non credevano o non volevano
            credere alll'esistenza della mafia e ora con coloro che non vedono altro che mafia.
            Di volta in volta sono stato accusato di diffamare la Sicilia e di difenderla troppo. Non sono infallibile,
             ma credo di aver detto qualche inoppugnabile verità.
            Ho 67 anni, ho da rimproverarmi e da rimpiangere molte cose, ma nessuna che abbia a che fare con la malafede, 
            la vanità e gli interessi particolari. Non ho,
            lo riconosco, il dono dell'opportunità e della prudenza. Ma si è come si è." </i>
            ("For thirty years now I have had to deal with those who didn't believe or didn't want to believe in the 
            existence of the mafia and now with those who see nothing
            but the mafia. Time after time I have been accused of defaming Sicily and defending it too much. I'm not infallible, 
            but I think I've told some indisputable truths.
            I'm 67 years old, I have many things to reproach and regret, but none that have to do with bad faith, vanity and 
            particular interests.
            I don't have, I admit, the gift of opportunity and prudence. But it is as it is").
            The writer's activity is marked by a stubborn will to seek the truth, through a courageous immersion in the murky 
            sphere of Italian political and social life of these years.
            This website wants to be a scholarly digital edition of the author's book that is present in the "<a href="sde.html">SDE </a>" section.
             In this latter the user can find 
            the visualization of the knowledge extraction made in the XML file of the book, foundable a the end of this page. 
            In order to enrich our SDE we also decided to create the page <a href="events.html">events </a> in which the user can find six important news 
            stories correlated to the Second Mafia War.
             Three of them are shown through the journal articles in which the news was spread. The chosen journal is the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera">Corriere 
             della Sera</a>", one of the most important
              journals in Italy. The work made on these articles started with the OCR scanning in order to create their XML file. 
              These last have been then connected 
              to the XML file of the book as additional material to support and make more understandable the topic for the user.
               On the other hand, the other three events
               are presented to the user in the form of video, that is the news report.

            <h2>People, places and evidences</h2>
            The favorite narrative form of Leonardo Sciascia was the detective story, in which the investigation is entrusted 
            to a character who embodies the values ​​of justice and rationality.
            This is the case of <i>"Una Storia Semplice"</i> in which this figure is represented by Antonio Lagandara, 
            the "brigadiere" (sergent). This latter is the protagonist of 
            the story. He was the son of a laborer elevated to the rank of pruner, he had finished his studies by graduating 
            with a degree in economics and business after his
            father's death. Thus, not knowing what path to take, he decided to enlist in the police force, becoming a non-commissioned
             officer five years later, although
            his true and only dream was to get a law degree. These humble roots and his values drove his thirst for the truth. 
            He is, in fact, the only character 
            seeking for justice with no need to hide anything.
            After realizing the importance the author gives to the different characters and their roles, we decided to highlight
             them in our SDE. The figure that the "brigadiere" has 
            to fight with is the police commissioner that shows the presence of corruption in the istitution that should fight against it.
             Another key personality is the "Uomo Volvo"
            that depicts the code of silence of a scared population, that does not feel protected. The secondary characters are described 
            directly in the XML file. 
            <br>
            Another crucial aspect is the setting: Sicily. In fact, the choice of highlighting also the places cited in the book is a means
             to better understand the 
            phenomenon under consideration. The places in which the plot takes place are, for instance, the train station or the police 
            station, all locations belonging 
            to the institutional sphere. These shows how mafia really governs everything. <br>
            The presence of the organised criminality is clear but not explicit, for this reason we decided to add the evidence button.
             Thanks to this latter, all the implicit 
            references to mafia are highlighted and made explicit. Just as for the characters the explanation of the different evidences
             will be provided in the XML file.

            <h2>Second Mafia War</h2>
            <p> 
              On April 23rd 1981, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Bontade">Stefano Bontate</a> was killed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Greco">Giuseppe Greco</a>. He was the Palermo Mafia boss who more than any other embodied the balance between crime politics and business.
               For many, this date marked the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Mafia_War">Second Mafia War</a>, after the first one that was fought in the sixties. The clash between the Corleone and Palermo clans, according to the
                reconstructions made so far, was motivated by the desire to manage firsthand the gains in drug trafficking that had become, by the seventies, Cosa Nostra's main criminal activity.
                 A treasure that at that time, was in the hands of Bontade, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Inzerillo"> Salvatore Inzerillo</a>and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Badalamenti">Badalamenti</a>. Eighteen days later the same happened 
                 to Salvatore Inzerillo, Bontade's right arm. He was also shot in the face and disfigured by bullets fired from his executioners' Kalashnikovs.
                  In the same year also his brothers, Santo and Pietro, were killed.
                 The victims of the second Mafia war, won by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleonesi_Mafia_clan">Corleoneses</a>, were probably more than a thousand. Moreover, within just five months <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pio_La_Torre">Pio La Torre</a> and 
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Alberto_dalla_Chiesa">Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa</a> were gunned down. The former was a Communist Party politician and member of the Anti-Mafia Parliamentari Commission,
                 who had had the courage to devise a bill that would provide for indictment for Mafia association. The second, who had moreover 
                 served in Corleone at the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placido_Rizzotto">Placido Rizzotto</a>'s murder, had been appointed prefect of Palermo not even five months before he died. 
                 The Second Mafia War has no "armistice" or "end of hostilities" date. After 1984, the number of casualties goes way down, both because of the 
                 achieved supremacy of the Corleonese and because of the blows dealt to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia"> Cosa Nostra </a>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonino_Caponnetto">Antonino Caponnetto</a>'s 
                 <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(magistratura_italiana)"> "anti-Mafia pool"</a>, of which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Falcone">Falcone </a>is the mastermind and stategist. 
                 First came the 366 arrest warrants due to the San Michele's blitz of September 1984, then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Trial">Palermo Maxiprocess</a>, which began on the 10th of february 1986, 
                 and concluded on the 16th of December 1987. Throughout the duration of the trial the Mafia remained as if in apnea, 
                 with no murders or striking actions. It was in the Maxiprocess that the events that had characterized that bloody season would be brought to
                 light.
