      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Chinnici">Rocco Chinnici</a> was an Italian magistrate.

      His name is linked to the idea of the establishment of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(magistratura_italiana)"> "anti-Mafia pool"</a>, which gave a decisive breakthrough in the fight against
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia">Cosa Nostra</a>. This was an area in which he is considered one of the most important personalities, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonino_Caponnetto"> Antonino Caponnetto</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Falcone">Giovanni Falcone</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Borsellino">Paolo Borsellino</a>. In 1970 he was assigned to the case of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viale_Lazio_massacre"><i>"Viale Lazio massacre,"</i></a> which included
        many names of Mafia criminals destined for later greater notoriety. In 1975, having reached the rank of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corte_d%27appello_(Italia)"> Court of Appeals </a>magistrate,
         he was appointed Deputy Instructing Counsel. He became a magistrate of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Cassation_(Italy)">Court of Cassation</a> and Instructing Councilor after another 
         four years, and as such, in that 1979 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Terranova">Cesare Terranova</a> was killed, he was called to the post of head of the office.
         After other murders Chinnici had the idea of establishing a collaborative structure among the magistrates of the Office
          (later known as the anti-Mafia pool). He was aware that the isolation of servants of the state exposes them to annihilation and makes them
          vulnerable, particularly judges and policemen. In fact, by killing those who investigate alone, one also buries with them the fruits of
          their investigations. Some young magistrates including Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino joined his team. They were already working on that
          "excellent" crime. In July 1982, the so-called <i>"Report of 162"</i> arrived on Chinnici's desk, drawn up jointly by Police and
        Carabinieri that highlighted, for the first time, the Mafia alignments involved in the then ongoing <b>Second Mafia War</b>:
      the "losing" (the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Bontade">Bontate</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Inzerillo">Inzerillo</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Badalamenti">Badalamenti</a> faction) and "winning" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Riina"> Tot√≤ Riina </a>'s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleonesi_Mafia_clan">Corleonesi</a>) groups, and the related 
      murders with scrupulous verification and matching.
      Chinnici decided to entrust the inquiry concerning the investigation to Judge Falcone, and the result of that impressive work would
      be the first major trial of Cosa Nostra, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Trial"> Palermo maxi-trial</a>. 
      Rocco Chinnici was killed at 8 a.m. on the 29th of July 1983 in a green Fiat 126, stuffed with 75 kilograms of explosives parked in front
       of his home in Via Giuseppe Pipitone Federico in Palermo, at the age of fifty-eight. Operating the remote control that caused the explosion
        was <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonino_Madonia">Antonino Madonia</a>, boss of Resuttana, who was hiding in the trunk of a stolen van parked nearby.
