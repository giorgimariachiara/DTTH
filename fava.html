        <h7>About</h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>38 years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Fava">Giuseppe Fava</a>, known as Pippo, was killed with five shots 
            from a 7.65 calibre pistol in front of the Teatro Stabile in Catania. 
             He was a journalist, writer, playwright, essayist and screenwriter.  
             Born in the province of Syracuse in 1925, he became a professional journalist
             in 1952.  
             
             In 1956 he was hired by "<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_Sera">Espresso sera</a>" where he remained until 1980 as  
             editor-in-chief. In 1980, he moved to the direction of a new editorial  
             reality: the "<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giornale_del_Sud">Giornale del Sud</a>". Fava immediately created a young and  
             fierce team with which he tackled the burning issues of Sicily in those 
             years. Building speculation, the ramification of Mafia connivance in  
             society. Il Giornale is irreverent, fearlessly denouncing the intermingling 
             of political power and mafia associations, building speculation, drug
             trafficking and o-pposing the creation of the Comiso missile base 
             His conviction is that Sicily is a metaphor for Italy.
             These themes have also characterised his work as a writer and scriptwriter,
             which began in his days at "Espresso sera". He wrote novels, plays and  
             collaborated on scripts for television and film, often based on his novels. 
             He hosts a radio programme on "<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_Radio">Radiorai</a>". The topics of the "Giornale del Sud"
             annoyed, after only a year the ownership of the newspaper changed hands, it
             was then discovered that the new editors were linked to mafia circles in Catania. 
             Giuseppe Fava is fired and shortly afterwards the newspaper closes. <br>
             <br>
             
             <i>
                "Io ho un concetto etico di giornalismo. <br>
                Ritengo infatti che in una società democratica <br> 
                e libera quale dovrebbe essere quella italiana,<br>
                il giornalismo rappresenti la forza essenziale della società.<br>
                A che serve vivere, se non c’è coraggio di lottare?""
             </i>
             <br>
             <br>
            ("I have an ethical concept of journalism. Indeed, I believe that in a democratic and free
             society such as Italy should be, journalism is the essential force in society.
            What is the point of living if there is no courage to fight?")
            Giuseppe did not give up, he founded 'Radar' a cooperative with the journalists of the
            old editorial staff of the newspaper who remained closest to him. In November of 
            1982, the first issue of the magazine, which would be published monthly, 'I Siciliani', came out.
            It immediately became a point of reference for the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimento_antimafia">anti-mafia movement</a>. The magazine's investigations
            magazine often became a political and journalistic case. 
            Giuseppe Fava signed an article linking four large Catanese entrepreneurs to the clan of boss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Santapaola">Nitto Santapaola</a> .
            The following year, the same entrepreneurs tried to buy the newspaper in order to control it, only to be refused.
            control the newspaper, obtaining only refusals. On 28 December 1983, he gave his last interview to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Biagi">Enzo Biagi</a>.
            

             He was killed in an ambush one rainy evening on 5 January 1984 in Via dello Stadio. 
             He had left the editorial office and was on his way to the Verga Theatre to pick up his
             59-year-old niece. He did not even have time to get out of the car. Initially the crime was
             labelled as a crime of passion, later it was said to be linked to the economic problems of the 
             Radar cooperative. Only later is it linked to the world of organised crime. And it was only in 
             2001 that Nitto Santapaola and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Ercolano">Aldo Ercolano</a> had their life sentences confirmed by the Catania 
             Court of Appeal, characters of a certain importance in the Cosa Nostra in Catania.
