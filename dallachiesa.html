      <h7>About</h7>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Alberto_dalla_Chiesa">Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa </a> was an italian general and prefect. He was the son of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romano_dalla_Chiesa">Romano dalla Chiesa</a>, a Carabinieri general native of Parma,
      and Maria Laura Bergonzi, a native of Piacenza. He joined the force during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">Second World War</a> and participated in the Resistance. 
      After the war he fought banditry first in Campania and later in Sicily; after various periods in Florence, Como, Rome 
      and Milan, between 1966 and 1973 he was again in Sicily where, with the rand of colonel, commander of the Carabinieri Legion in Palermo, 
      he investigated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia">Cosa Nostra</a>. In 1982 he was also appointed prefect of Palermo with the task of countering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia">Cosa Nostra</a> as he had done in the
       fight against terrorism. In the Sicilian capital he was killed a few months after taking office, in the Via Carini massacre in which his wife
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuela_Setti_Carraro"> Emanuela Setti Carraro</a> and escort agent <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3713228">Domenico Russo</a> also perished.
       He was awarded a gold medal of civilian valor in memory; his body is currently buried in Villetta Cemetery, Parma. 
       <i>"Their barbaric killing represented one of the most serious moments of organized crime's attack on the institutions 
       and the men who personified them,"</i> this is what the President of the Republic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Mattarella">Sergio Mattarella</a> wrote in a note, 
       <i>"but, at the same time, it ended up accentuating even more an unbridgeable furrow between the wounded city and that
         mafia that continued to want to determine its destinies through intimidation and death. To that odious challenge,
          the national community as a whole, though stricken and shaken, was able to react by making itself strong with the
           same determined and lucid energy of which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Alberto_dalla_Chiesa">Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa </a> had already set an example, during his brilliant
            career in the Carabinieri Corps, in his commitment against criminal and terrorist organizations."</i>
