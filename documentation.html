            <h2>The project</h2>
            <p>The project <i>"Sicilia '80"</i> was born with the aim of showing the political,
            social and cultural situation in Sicily during the 80s.
            We decided to set as a starting point the book of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Sciascia">Leonardo Sciascia</a>: <i>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una_storia_semplice_(novel)">Una storia semplice</a>"</i>.
            Leonardo Sciascia was in fact the first italian 
            writer to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia">mafia</a> in a novel. As he claimed: <i>"Ho dovuto fare i conti da trent'anni a 
            questa parte prima con coloro che non credevano o non volevano
            credere alll'esistenza della mafia e ora con coloro che non vedono altro che mafia.
            Di volta in volta sono stato accusato di diffamare la Sicilia e di difenderla troppo. Non sono infallibile,
             ma credo di aver detto qualche inoppugnabile verità.
            Ho 67 anni, ho da rimproverarmi e da rimpiangere molte cose, ma nessuna che abbia a che fare con la malafede, 
            la vanità e gli interessi particolari. Non ho,
            lo riconosco, il dono dell'opportunità e della prudenza. Ma si è come si è." </i>
            ("For thirty years now I have had to deal with those who didn't believe or didn't want to believe in the 
            existence of the mafia and now with those who see nothing
            but the mafia. Time after time I have been accused of defaming Sicily and defending it too much. I'm not infallible, 
            but I think I've told some indisputable truths.
            I'm 67 years old, I have many things to reproach and regret, but none that have to do with bad faith, vanity and 
            particular interests.
            I don't have, I admit, the gift of opportunity and prudence. But it is as it is").
            The writer's activity is marked by a stubborn will to seek the truth, through a courageous immersion in the murky 
            sphere of Italian political and social life of these years.
            This website wants to be a scholarly digital edition of the author's book that is present in the "<a href="sde.html">SDE </a>" section.
             In this latter the user can find 
            the visualization of the knowledge extraction made in the XML file of the book, foundable a the end of this page. 
            In order to enrich our SDE we also decided to create the page <a href="events.html">Second Mafia War </a> in which the user can find a timeline of the crucial events of the Second Mafia War (created using the open-source tool <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make">TimelineJS</a>). We also decided to deepen six of these events.
             Three of them are shown through the journal articles in which the news was spread. The chosen journal is the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera">Corriere 
             della Sera</a>", one of the most important
              journals in Italy. The work made on these articles started with the OCR scanning in order to create their XML file. 
              These last have been then connected 
              to the XML file of the book as additional material to support and make more understandable the topic for the user.
               On the other hand, the other three events
               are presented to the user in the form of video, that is the news report.

            <h2>People, places and evidences</h2>
            The favorite narrative form of Leonardo Sciascia was the detective story, in which the investigation is entrusted 
            to a character who embodies the values ​​of justice and rationality.
            This is the case of <i>"Una Storia Semplice"</i> in which this figure is represented by Antonio Lagandara, 
            the "brigadiere" (sergent). This latter is the protagonist of 
            the story. He was the son of a laborer elevated to the rank of pruner, he had finished his studies by graduating 
            with a degree in economics and business after his
            father's death. Thus, not knowing what path to take, he decided to enlist in the police force, becoming a non-commissioned
            officer five years later. However his true and only dream was to get a law degree. These humble roots and his values drove his thirst for the truth. 
            He is, in fact, the only character 
            seeking for justice with no need to hide anything.
            After realizing the importance that the author gives to the different <b>characters</b> and their <b>roles</b>, we decided to highlight
            them in our SDE. The figure that the "brigadiere" has 
            to fight with is the police commissioner. This last shows the presence of corruption in the istitution that should, instead, fight against it.
            Another key personality is the "Uomo Volvo"
            that depicts the code of silence of a scared population, that does not feel protected. The secondary characters are described 
            directly in the  <a href="xmlfiles/unastoriasempliceoff.xml">XML </a> file. 
            <br>
            Another crucial aspect is the </b>setting</b>: Sicily. In fact, the choice of highlighting also the places cited in the book is a means
             to better understand the 
            phenomenon under consideration. The places in which the plot takes place are, for instance, the train station or the police 
            station, all locations belonging 
            to the institutional sphere. These shows how <b>mafia really governs everything</b>. <br>
            The presence of the organised criminality is clear but not explicit, for this reason we decided to add the evidence button.
            Thanks to this latter, all the implicit 
            references to mafia are highlighted and made explicit. Just as for the characters the explanation of the different <b>evidences</b>
             will be provided in the  <a href="xmlfiles/unastoriasempliceoff.xml">XML </a> file.                     
            
            </p>

            <h2>Data modeling process and methodologies</h2>
            <p>
              As Michael Sperberg-McQueen stated in his keynote to the 2012 workshop on Knowledge Organization
              and Data Modeling: <i>“Modeling is a way to make explicit our assumptions about
              the nature of a text/artefact”</i>. 
              The data model, or schema, defines types of documents by specifying the data
              elements they may contain and the sequences and structures those elements may form: in other words, 
              the “grammar” of the document.  The most widely used schemas for humanities research data are the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). 
              Text Encoding Initiative
              (TEI) attempted something rather more ambitious. From the start, its intention
              was to create an explicit model of the objects and structures that intelligent
              readers claim to perceive when reading a text; the explicit claim was that by
              modeling those readings, and assigning a secondary role to the rendition of actual
              source documents, the goals of integration and preservation of digital surrogates
              would be greatly simplified.
              On the other side, the metamodel is essentially an agreement (expressed as a formal standard) about notation and syntax, 
              and a protocol for defining descriptive systems or “languages” that use this syntax and for defining 
              their vocabularies and grammars.
              Data modeling using a meta model like XML is usually adding descriptive information about 
              the data; typical operations are querying the data for specific subsets.
              Texts have structure, but typically not of the closely defined, repetitive form that we associate with a table. 
              The structure of text is governed by pattern that permits more variation, allowing alternatives, omissions, repetitions, and recursions. 
              Texts are sequences in the sense defined above, and a grammar-based instrument like the extensible Markup Language (XML) is the most 
              effective approach to modeling this form of open-ended structure. 

                <h3>The Digital Humanities' Paradox</h3>
              A book called Data and Reality (Kent, 1978), first published in 1978, comes
              from that heroic age of database design and development.
              Kent’s quietly subversive message was that this was a struggle predominantly over terminology.
              He noted that almost all of these passionately advocated models were fundamentally
              very similar, differing only in their names, and in the specific
              compromises they chose when confronted by the messiness of reality. Whether
              you call them relations or objects or records, the globs of storage handled by
              every database system were still combinations of fields containing binary
              representations of perceptions of reality, chosen and combined, for their utility in
              a specific context.
              This example of fuzzy dates in the humanities and what modeling may entice
              is representative of the general paradox that lies at the base of the digital
              humanities: to treat a humanities domain within a digital environment, it is
              necessary to model it in an unambiguous way, but this cannot be done in full
              because ambiguity and fuzziness is an inherent characteristic of the data. What
              will normally happen in these and similar cases is that the person or people
              preparing the model will have to make choices and compromises.
              The act of choosing is a defining characteristic of modeling, for this reason it 
              seems evident that subjectivity is
              an unavoidable component of the humanities.

                <h2>Our process</h2>
                <p>The following paragraph will explain the process of data modeling we adopted, based on the model of Elena Pierazzo.  
                
              1. The first step is the analytical activity, the core of modeling. It consists in the analysis of the choosen domain, that in our case is the criminal organization <i>Mafia</i>.
               Through this analysis is possible to select the features connected to the topic. The main part of our corpora is composed by the novel <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una_storia_semplice_(romanzo)">Una Storia Semplice" by Leonardo Sciascia</a>. 
               We have created a digital edition of the book published by <a href="https://www.adelphi.it">Adelphi</a>. The metamodel used in order to markup the text is XML and the schema most suitable for this kind of material was, in our opinion, TEI.
                Whith the usage of this specific data model it was possible to make the reading comprehension of the novel.
                 The explanation of the roles of the characters makes clear the factions that coexist in a corrupted society. Through the highlighting of the Evidences (look People Places Evidences section) the untold is made explicit. All the stylistic choices made by the author to refer to the Mafia are highlighted in the <a href="sde.html">SDE</a> page. 
               In order to enrich the digitalization of this book we selected additional 
               material helpful to understand the historical background.
                In the timeline present in the <a href="events.html">Second Mafia War</a> 
                page, there is the result of the listing of the most important episodes 
                of the this last. As Unsworth suggested the act of selecting, is an act of simplifying: by selecting some of the
                features of the object to be modeled and discarding others, we make such an
                object simpler and thereby tractable. In fact, simplification is an essential characteristic
                of a model: a model must be smaller and simpler than the objects it models.
                In the <a href="events.html">same page</a>, we also decided to deepen six 
                those events.  Three of them are shown through the journal articles in which the news was spread. 
                The chosen journal is the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera"></b>Corriere 
                  della Sera</a>". The data model used in this case is <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">The Journal Publishing Tag Set</a>, this last
                   defines elements
                   and attributes that describe the content and metadata of journal articles, including research articles; 
                   subject-review articles; non-research articles; letters; editorials; book, software, and product reviews;
                    peer reviews, and author responses included with an article. The Tag Set allows for descriptions of the
                     full article content or just the article header metadata.
                     <br>
                  2. The criterion of sampling evoked by Unsworth is directed by a particular <b>point
                  of view</b> or by a <b>purpose</b> of research. Besides the main goal that is the explanation of the socio-cultural situation in Sicily in the '80s,
                   the selection made in this project was guided three main purposes:
                    a. Show the brutality of Mafia that acts mercilessly;
                    b. Make explicit the corruption present in the italian society;
                    c. Create a storytelling of the Second Mafia War, showing the factions of the different sicilian bosses. 
                  <br>

                    3. A model can also be defined by its <b>function</b>. 
                    Following the distinction made by McCarty in his 
                    seminal work, we can define our model as
                     "<b>model-of</b>", a model that aims to get to 
                     know the domain better. In the McCarty definition of model:<i> "A ‘model’ I take to be either a representation of something for purposes
                      of study [model-of], or a design for realizing something new [model-for]”
                      "</i>
